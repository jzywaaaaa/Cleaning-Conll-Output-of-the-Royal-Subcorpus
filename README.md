# Cleaning Conll Output of the Royal Subcorpus

This tool cleans the [non-standard conll data of the Royal Subcorpus](https://github.com/cdli-gh/mtaac_syntax_corpus/tree/master/royal/release) to cdli-conll format. 

An example of cdli-conll data can be found [here](https://github.com/cdli-gh/mtaac_gold_corpus/tree/workflow/morph/to_dict).

## Usage

1. Download the non-standard conll data of the Royal Subcorpus either from its [original repo](https://github.com/cdli-gh/mtaac_syntax_corpus/tree/master/royal/release/data) or from the zip file provided in this repo. REMEMBER: you must name the folder __royal_subcorpus_data__.

2. Download the conll files generated by the ATF converter. REMEMBER: you must name the folder __atf_converted_data__. You can do this in two ways:
    1. Simply download the zip file provided in this repo;
    2. Download the original data dump from here, install the ATF converter, and then run the ATF converter on the data dump.

3. Download the Conll_clean_up.py. Make sure that the two folers (royal_subcorpus_data and atf_converted_data) and the python script are in the same working directory.

4. Open a terminal at the folder and run the following command:
````
python3 Conll_clean_up.py
````
You should then see the cleaned up gold-standard conll files in the folder. Any files erroring out in the clean-up process would be marked out.
